# README.md for Latex Document Class
## Overview

This repository contains a custom LaTeX document class for use in mathematical writing. It includes a number of commonly used packages and customizations to enhance the typesetting of mathematical content.

This LaTeX template has only been heavily adjusted by myself. The original template was not created by me.

## Package List

The following packages are included in this document class:

  - `babel` with the ngerman language option
  - `hyphenat` for hyphenation in German text
  - `enumitem` for custom enumerated lists
  - `flafter` for floating objects
  - `microtype` for improved typography
  - `tikz` for creating graphics
  - `xcolor` for color management
  - `geometry` for page layout
  - `fancyhdr` for custom headers and footers
  - `inputenc` and `fontenc` for encoding and font management
  - `tgpagella` and `mathpazo` for font selection
  - `mathtools` for mathematical tools
  - `amsthm` for theorem formatting
  - `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `mathrsfs`, and `marvosym` for mathematical symbols and fonts
  - `blkarray` for block arrays
  - `booktabs` for table formatting
  - `bigstrut` for strut manipulation in tables
  - `listings` for source code formatting
  - `wasysym` for mathematical symbols
  - `marginnote` for margin notes
  - `amstex` for compatibility with older LaTeX documents
  - `polynom` for polynomial operations
  - `ulem` for underlining text
  - `cancel` for cancelling terms

## Customizations

This document class includes the following customizations:

  - Defining mathematical symbols for the sets `\R`, `\Z`, `\N`, `\Q`, `\C`, `\K`, and `\F`
  - Redefining the command `\obar` for creating overbars
  - Defining custom mathematical operations, such as `\norm`, `\abs`, `\floor`, `\ceil`, `\maxn`, `\diffrac`, and `\scalProd`
  - Defining a custom clrblock environment for creating colored boxes with custom titles
  - Source code formatting using the listings package

## Usage

To use this document class, simply include the contents of the `template.tex` in the same directory as your document. The customizations and packages included in this document class should be available for use in your document.

Make sure to replace the placeholder text with your own content.

## Requirements

This template requires a LaTeX distribution to be installed on your system. Some popular LaTeX distributions include:

  - TeX Live
  - MikTeX
  - MacTeX (for macOS)

## Disclaimer

This README file is current as of February 1st, 2023. I am not sure whether I will ever be that motivated again to update the README according to future adjustments in the template.
